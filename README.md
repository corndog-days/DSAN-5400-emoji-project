## Project Description

This **Emoji Book Recommender** is a Python-based tool that lets users find books with an emoji query. The driving question behind this project was: How can we create a unique, interesting way to recommend books to the user? 

In some areas, a user might not have fully articulated keywords in mind for a search. One case of that is looking for something new to read! Users might not know exactly what topic theyâ€™re looking for, exactly what genre or age range they want, or have a specific title or author in mind. But they tend to have at least light preferences in some of these areas. Our idea, then, is to experiment with a fun, engaging method of input in a context where precision may not be the goal for the user.

This project takes a new look at the NLP task of information retrieval. We use:
- A manually annotated emoji-to-keyword mapping
- A book dataset from Kaggle with descriptions of each book
- A term-document matrix that retrieves the closest matching book to the query

- Also included are several "dormant" files which are not a part of the main UI, but can be used to operate the software with a user-chosen dataset of books. To operate these other utility files, users will need to run them using the command line, putting in file paths as arguments.

## How To Use

### Generating Keyword-Book Matrix:
Note: This should be done before running main. 
Run emoji_book_rec/emoji_book_rec/utils/create_kw_book_tsv.py. The file contains an optional argument, "filepath," which allows the user to use their own dataset. If none is specified, a default from Kaggle will be used. 

### User Interface:
1. Launch the GUI
2. Select up to 5 emoji from the emoji keyboard (you can use multiple of any emoji to weight your search more to that emoji!)
3. Submit your emoji query
4. Receive back a list of recommended books based on the emoji input

### Back-end Flow:
- Each emoji maps to 5 curated keywords (with the first one weighted extra to ensure more topical results)
- Book descriptions are indexed into a keyword matrix (supporting synonyms via WordNet).
- Emoji keywords are matched to the matrix and used to rank books by relevance.
- Scores from the index are then weighted based on how many different keywords were found in a given book description, as a way to take the entire contents of the query into account.
- A sorted list of 5 recommendations is returned in the GUI.
- The software logs messages throughout, which are output to the logging file. This includes the top 25 results of the search for extra data.
